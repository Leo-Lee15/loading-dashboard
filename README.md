# loading-dashboard

A css loading page implemented for shiny dashboard

Creating a loading page for a shiny dashboard is slightly more complicated because the sidebar and header needs to be hidden during the loading and then revealed after loading has finished. To do this, the app makes use of the great **shinyjs** package.

The css code has been taken from [**here**](https://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders/)
